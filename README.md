# MIT6.00.1xSolutions
Problem set, quiz and final exam solutions for the course MITx:6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python.

It is highly recommended to solve the problem sets, quiz and final exam by your own, and only use these solutions as a guide in case of having trouble.

Though the course uses Python 2, the solutions provided in this repository were written using Python 3. I strongly disagree using Python 2 because according to Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, the future of this programming language is Python 3. The main reason for using Python 2 in the course is lacking enough scientific libraries for Python 3. However, Anaconda provides enough libraries fully compatible with Python 3.
